Each pokemon is defined by a key, a name, a type and an ability (talent). Types and abilities are stored in the given files : abilities.json and types.json. A user who would modify/create a pokemon is able to pick a type and an ability issued from those files.You will use NodeJS, Express and EJS.An abstraction layer is implemented in the file functions.js The Model itself will be implemented with the use of Arrays. The persistence of the data is implemented with a simple text file on the server side.
